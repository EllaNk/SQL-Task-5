# Joins and aggregate functions

## Introduction:

SQL offers a powerful way to generate business questions and effectively uncover valuable insights from a large data set.

In this task, four business questions were formulated and employed SQL commands such as ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS to obtain valuable insights from the superstore table.

These commands serve as tools for summarizing and structuring data, enabling easy identification of trends within the business data.

## Problem Statement:
Come up with 4 business questions and query the tables provided. Ensure you use the following commands;

- JOINS
- GROUP BY
- At least 2 AGGREGATE functions
- ORDER BY

## Generated Questions:
