# Joins and aggregate functions

## Introduction:

SQL offers a powerful way to generate business questions and effectively uncover valuable insights from a large data set.

In this task, four business questions were formulated and employed SQL commands such as ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and AGGREGATE FUNCTIONS to obtain valuable insights from the superstore table.

These commands serve as tools for summarizing and structuring data, enabling easy identification of trends within the business data.

## Problem Statement:
Come up with 4 business questions and query the tables provided. Ensure you use the following commands;

- JOINS
- GROUP BY
- At least 2 AGGREGATE functions
- ORDER BY

## Generated Questions:

1. Join two tables (Employee_info tabel and Employee_salary table) to get the name and salary at one display
2. Calculate the average salary from the Employee_salary table
3. Sum the total salary of all the employee from the employee_salary table
Calculate the average profit yearly increment
Calculate the sum of yearly increments
Show names, emails, and Pincodes where the pin code is greater than 410000 and displays them in descending order.
Join the employee and salary tables having the EmpID as the unique Numbe

Join two tables (Employee_info tabel and Employee_salary table) to get the name and salary at one display:

![](Table_Joins.png)

The above snapshot shows the Employee name and Employee salary at one display. Which was generated by joining two tables (Employee_info tabel and Employee_salary table). The syntax used to achieve this result is as follows;

_Use staff;_

_Select Name, Salary from employee_info_

_join employee_salary;

The average salary from the Employee_salary table:

![](Average_Salary.png)


The above snapshot shows the average salary from the Employee_Salary table. And the syntax use is as follows;

_Select * from Employee_salary;_

_Select Avg(Salary) As `Average salary` from employee_salary;_

Total salary of all the employee from the employee_salary table:

_Select Sum(Salary) As `Total Salary` from employee_salary;_
